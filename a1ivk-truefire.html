I already put new strings on it, as one was missing and I didnt know the condition of the rest, so I swapped them all out with Elixir strings 9-42. I tuned it to EADGBE I am very busy and work at night so lessons arent an option for me right now, although, I'd love to take them at some point. For now, I am looking into some video lessons that can be purchased and done at my pace. The top one I am considering So right now I’m in the market for a teacher/course I can take online. I’ve looked heavily into texasbluesalley.com and really like what he has to offer there. My play style is very similar in taste and I really like the material in there. I’m very humble/shy about my skill but I like to think I’m getting pretty good so I have no doubt I’ll be able to handle all of the material there. I guess my real question would be, have any of you ever used this website before? I’m an “okay” guitarist but I love blues and would like to learn the basics, can’t afford in person person lessons and also don’t have the time. What are all of your online recommendations? Free or priced (but not too expensive). Looking through all the spoilers etc for WAR and of course the brain starts to get brewing. Having played against a few mildly successful RW decks focused on casting \ \ Star of Extinction\ \ while \ \ Truefire Captain\ \ is in play, i realized that perhaps \ \ Gideon's Sacrifice\ \ might be a way to make the deck more consistent and also make it so the cost is 1 cmc instead of 7. being able to play against a stompy or aggro deck and turn their turn 5 lethal swing into a 1 mana insta Are you currently struggling in the Bo1 meta to maintain any source of sanity? Are you tired of watching Wildgrowth Walkers grow up to be the bully they faced daily in grade school that now beats your ass outside bars for nodding at him? Are you tired of watching your RDW opponent tap 1 mana and deal three damage, then tap 2 mana and deal 3 damage, and finally tap 3 mana to deal 3 damage to your freshly lotioned face? If so, have you considered our Standard lord and saviour: Boros Land Destru. i just fell for \ \ truefire captain\ \ + \ \ star of extinction\. 
I have been testing out a boros dinos decklist that i really enjoy and that i think has some potential to be a reasonably powerful deck that has janky win cons, but can also hold its own without hitting a win con, which is common problem for combo decks.

This is the official discussion thread for Limited Resources 463 – Guilds of Ravnica Archetype Breakdown - https://ift.tt/2yBuOiL. Hey all, I've had this idea for quite a while, and now that Guilds of Ravnica is out, I was wondering if y'all could help me make it a reality. I'd like to make a set of 10 decks for casual play, one for each of the Ravnica guilds, using cards from all 3 blocks. These decks would be for me to play with my non-Magic playing friends, to try and get them more comfortable with the game, and just generally have fun. Ideally, each deck would be balanced against each other, representative of its guild.
