                            <p> Anyone know of an ios app like iStumbler for mac--and app that allows you to view all the wifi signals with detailed info? I'm asking this in /r/jailbreak because I was told that normal ios apps don't have that sort of access to the iphone/ipad's wifi antennae. Mozilla Stumbler is an open-source wireless network scanner that collects GPS data for the Mozilla Location Service, our crowd-sourced location database. As you move around, the app "stumbles" upon new Wi-Fi networks and cell towers. Best news update of (my) year 6:34 PM (day 6) update 17: The police got a warrant, searched the house, and confiscated my computer. FUCK YEAH. They just have to take pictures of it for evidence and I get it back TOMORROW! I'm so happy that I just peed. Everywhere. All over myself. Speaking of peeing myself, I was in the police station this morning explaining the steps I took to the detective on the case as well as one of their IT guys to validate my methods.

I'm done with FF as of 57. I've been using cyberfox on desktop for a while now anyway, to be replaced with WF when 52ESR gets long in the tooth. While I thank you for releasing the android version some of it is pretty much straight firefox. The permissions are the same, asking for camera, mic, run at startup, contacts, etc. I disable those of course but thought you might have changed it for the better. Then there are the services. Waterfox still has telemetryuploadservice and the wifi stumbler. NetStumbler (also known as Network Stumbler) is a tool for Windows that facilitates detection of Wireless LANs using the 802.11b, 802.11a and 802.11g WLAN standards.It runs on Microsoft Windows operating systems from Windows 2000 to Windows.

According to my point of view, network stumbler is a wifi scanner tool for all windows. It verifies the network is configured or not, study network strength, point directional antennas for long distance and identify interference between one or more wireless networks. Basic Router Setup You should get assistance from the router's manual for this. Connect modem with ethernet cable, to the WAN port of the router Connect LAN port from the router to a computer's ethernet port Open browser, navigate to 192.168.1.1, possibly 192.168.0.1 Default gateway: 192.168.1.1 possibly 192.168.0.1, please consult your manual Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 To enable WIFI, set up Wireless Network, it's recommended that you set up WPA-2 Personal Security.

I live in a place, where I have to use a municipal WiFi network that is broadcasted from several routers. They all share the same WiFi name and by default OS X connects (and shows) the one with the strongest signal. I can see all the others with any WiFi scanner (like the built in one in Wireless Diagnostics or iStumbler), but there is no way to actually select which one to connect to. Problem is, the router that usually has the best signal has the worst internet connection. Using WiFi Stumbler, I picked an unused channel for my network that had the least amount of interference based on number of connections, nearby busy channels, and signal strength from surrounding devices on those nearby channels. I know a relatively small amount about networking but I'll try and describe my issue as best I can. I've hooked up routers and switches, installed and messed with ddwrt, and connected wifi networks together but as far as real knowledge on how it all actually works I'm pretty lacking. Hopefully someone here can help me troubleshoot my problem. I'm an iOS programmer and I'll often spend time working with an iphone and a macbook at a starbucks. Recently I've been working on an app that connects. Hi there guys, Was curious if there's any apps that makes it possible to scan the Wi-Fi channels on your Windows Phone? On Android there's an app called Wifi Analyzer (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.farproc.wifi.analyzeramphl=en) and on iOS there's an app called Stumbler (https://code.google.com/p/iphone-wireless/wiki/Stumbler). Any idea if there's any alternatives on Windows Phone? Thanks in advance, Cyphe. Hi. Where I live the only ISP I have the option of using assigns a static IP (at least I think) via adsl. Very slow too. I believe it's advertised at 2mb. They give me a cheap off brand piece o' _____ chinese modem, and I have to manually enter all the tcp/ip info. It won't work with DHCP in my experience. This hasn't been a big problem, but I recently realized my Airport Extreme (squarish model w/out TC) drops internet without dropping wifi regularly. I always thought it was just the crappy. Our new wifi adapters does not give a SNR value, but does give us the Signal Strength and Noise level. Can I get the SNR value by simply subtracting the Noise level from the Signal Strength? Are there any tools out there that will display my adapter's SNR? Network Stumbler always give a noise level of -100, so I don't think its getting the right info from my cards Thanks. I noticed that when I change the channel that my wifi signal is broadcasting on to a channel that no one around me is broadcasting on, my interenet speed is much faster. (I use iStumbler to see which channel is open.) I noticed that when I switch the channel to one that no one else is using, another router name will switch to the same channel. It's happened like 4 or 5 times. Every time I switch to a channel that no one else is using, this router switches to that same channel. Does this indica. 
Hello folks, I have a massive problem with my home Wi-Fi. Frustratingly enough, I can't even pinpoint what's wrong exactly because the whole situation is so weird. Allow me to explain: (this might get a little long, but I'm trying to be thorough) The home in question is a three-story (ground floor + 2) medium-sized brick-wall house. The ground floor has an ADSL modem connected to an ancient ZyXEL Prestige-series router. The router feeds into an AirPort Extreme, with another, older AirPort. Hi there everyone!
